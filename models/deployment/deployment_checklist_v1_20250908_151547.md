# Airbnb Price Prediction Model Deployment Checklist

## Model Information
- **Model**: Stacking Ensemble
- **Version**: v1_20250908_151547
- **Created**: 2025-09-08 15:15:47
- **Performance**: RÂ² = 0.2253, MAE = $54

## Pre-Deployment Tests
- [ ] Model loads correctly from pickle file
- [ ] Inference pipeline works with sample data
- [ ] Predictions are in reasonable range ($10-$1000)
- [ ] Feature engineering pipeline is compatible
- [ ] Error handling works for edge cases

## Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Python 3.8+
- [ ] Required packages: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, pickle
- [ ] Sufficient memory for model loading
- [ ] CPU/GPU resources for inference

## Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Prediction latency monitoring
- [ ] Model drift detection
- [ ] Feature distribution monitoring
- [ ] Error rate tracking
- [ ] Business metric tracking (booking rates, revenue impact)

## Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Test model in staging environment
2. [ ] Load test with expected traffic
3. [ ] A/B test against baseline model
4. [ ] Deploy to production with rollback plan
5. [ ] Monitor performance for 24-48 hours
